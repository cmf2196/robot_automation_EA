Model Generation Instructions:

                First run an optimization algorithm of your choosing in the main of EA_library.py
                Once complete, the robot can be visualized using the method commented out in EA_library.py

This is a semester project for Columbia University Class MECS 4510, Evolutionary Computation and Automotive Design.
Thank you to Dr. Hod LIpson for guidance with this project, and teaching on the topic of evolutiony algorithms.

Additional Comments:

The simulator does not include collision prevention. This would be an excellent next step for improving the class.
